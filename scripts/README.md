## Specific notes for BLCA
step 1: install BLCA tool under this directory

step 2: create NCBI 16S RefSeq database using BLCA script

step 3: modify NCBI taxonomy (16SMicrobial.ACC.taxonomy) since there are missing taxonomic ranks in NCBI taxonomy for 16S RefSeq; taxonomy file has to be seven ranks for downstream applications
